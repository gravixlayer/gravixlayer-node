# 🧹 Remove Actions-User from Contributors

## 🎯 **The Issue**

The "actions-user" is showing up in your GitHub contributors because GitHub Actions was making commits with a generic user account. This makes it look like you have contributors when you want to be the only one.

## ✅ **Solutions Applied**

### **1. Fixed Future Commits**
- Updated GitHub Actions to use your credentials (`sukrithpvs@gmail.com`, `Sukrith`)
- No more version bump commits (to avoid extra commits)
- Only tags are created, no commit history pollution

### **2. Clean Up Existing History**
Run this command to remove actions-user from git history:

```bash
npm run cleanup-contributors
```

**What it does:**
- Rewrites git history to change all "actions-user" commits to your name
- Removes the actions-user from contributors list
- Creates a backup before making changes
- Optionally force-pushes the cleaned history

## 🚀 **Quick Fix (Recommended)**

### **Option 1: Clean History**
```bash
npm run cleanup-contributors
```
- Follow the prompts
- This will rewrite history and remove actions-user
- Force push to update GitHub

### **Option 2: Fresh Start (Nuclear Option)**
If you want a completely clean repository:

```bash
# Create a new branch with clean history
git checkout --orphan clean-main
git add .
git commit -m "feat: initial clean commit with complete gravixlayer SDK"
git branch -D main
git branch -m main
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## 📋 **What's Changed for Future**

### **GitHub Actions Now:**
- ✅ Uses your email: `sukrithpvs@gmail.com`
- ✅ Uses your name: `Sukrith`
- ✅ No version bump commits (cleaner history)
- ✅ Only creates tags for releases

### **Your Workflow Stays the Same:**
```bash
npm run push-publish
# or
git add .
git commit -m "feat: your changes"
git push
```

## 🔍 **Verify Contributors**

After cleanup, check your contributors:
- **GitHub**: https://github.com/gravixlayer/gravixlayer-node/graphs/contributors
- **Local**: `git shortlog -sn`

You should see only:
```
    X  Sukrith
```

## 🚨 **Important Notes**

1. **History Rewrite**: The cleanup script rewrites git history
2. **Backup Created**: A backup branch is created before changes
3. **Force Push Required**: You'll need to force push the cleaned history
4. **One-Time Fix**: After cleanup, future commits will be clean

## 🎯 **Expected Result**

After running the cleanup:
- ✅ Only "Sukrith" appears in contributors
- ✅ No "actions-user" or "GitHub Action"
- ✅ Clean commit history
- ✅ All functionality preserved

## 🛠️ **Manual Alternative**

If the script doesn't work, you can manually clean up:

```bash
# Rewrite author for all commits
git filter-branch --env-filter '
  if [ "$GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL" = "action@github.com" ]; then
    export GIT_AUTHOR_NAME="Sukrith"
    export GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL="sukrithpvs@gmail.com"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_NAME="Sukrith"
    export GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL="sukrithpvs@gmail.com"
  fi
' --force -- --all

# Force push
git push --force-with-lease origin main
```

## 🎉 **Final Result**

After cleanup, your repository will show:
- **Contributors**: Only you (Sukrith)
- **Commit History**: Clean and professional
- **Functionality**: Exactly the same
- **Auto-Publishing**: Still works perfectly

**Run the cleanup when you're ready to have a clean contributor list!** 🚀
