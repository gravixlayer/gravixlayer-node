# GitHub Actions NPM Publishing Fix

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Test Order Problem**
- **Issue**: GitHub Actions was trying to run unit tests before building the project
- **Problem**: Unit tests required built files in `dist/` directory
- **Fix**: Created pre-build tests that don't require built files and reordered workflow steps

### 2. **Test Configuration**
- **Issue**: `npm test` was trying to run Jest (not configured)
- **Fix**: Updated to run simple pre-build tests that verify source code structure

### 3. **Workflow Steps Order**
- **Before**: Install → Test → Build → Publish
- **After**: Install → Pre-build Tests → Build → Post-build Tests → Publish

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Created Simple Pre-Build Tests (`test/simple-unit-test.cjs`)
```javascript
// Tests that run BEFORE build:
- Package configuration validation
- Source files existence check
- Type definitions verification
- Resource files verification
- Build configuration check
```

### 2. Updated Package.json Scripts
```json
{
  "test": "node test/simple-unit-test.cjs",        // Pre-build tests
  "test:unit": "node test/unit-test.cjs",          // Post-build tests
  "test:simple": "node test/simple-unit-test.cjs"  // Alias
}
```

### 3. Updated GitHub Actions Workflow
```yaml
- name: Run pre-build tests    # ✅ NEW: Tests source code
  run: npm test

- name: Build project          # ✅ Build the project
  run: npm run build

- name: Run post-build tests   # ✅ NEW: Tests built files
  run: npm run test:unit
```

## 🚀 Next Steps to Publish

### Step 1: Set Up NPM Authentication
```bash
# Login to NPM locally (for testing)
npm login

# Create NPM token for GitHub Actions
npm token create --read-only=false
```

### Step 2: Add NPM Token to GitHub
1. Go to: https://github.com/gravixlayer/gravixlayer-node/settings/secrets/actions
2. Click "New repository secret"
3. Name: `NPM_TOKEN`
4. Value: Paste your NPM token
5. Click "Add secret"

### Step 3: Test the Workflow
1. Go to: https://github.com/gravixlayer/gravixlayer-node/actions
2. Click "Manual Release and Publish"
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose "patch" version type
5. Click "Run workflow"

## ✅ Expected Workflow Results

The workflow should now:
1. ✅ **Install dependencies** - `npm ci`
2. ✅ **Run pre-build tests** - Verify source code structure
3. ✅ **Build project** - Create `dist/` files
4. ✅ **Run post-build tests** - Test the built SDK
5. ✅ **Bump version** - Update package.json version
6. ✅ **Create GitHub release** - Create release with tag
7. ✅ **Publish to NPM** - Upload to NPM registry

## 🔍 Verification Commands

Test locally before running GitHub Actions:

```bash
# Test pre-build tests
npm test

# Build the project
npm run build

# Test post-build tests
npm run test:unit

# Test NPM publishing (dry run)
npm publish --dry-run
```

## 🎯 Success Indicators

When everything works:
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow completes without errors
- ✅ New release appears on GitHub: https://github.com/gravixlayer/gravixlayer-node/releases
- ✅ Package published to NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/gravixlayer
- ✅ Version number incremented in package.json

## 🚨 If It Still Fails

Check these common issues:
1. **NPM_TOKEN not set**: Add the secret in GitHub repository settings
2. **NPM login required**: Run `npm login` locally first
3. **Package name taken**: Change package name in package.json
4. **Build fails**: Check TypeScript compilation errors

The main issue was the test order - now it's fixed! 🎉
