# Workflow Test Examples

## How the New Release Notes Will Look

### Example 1: Feature Commits
**Your commits:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add streaming support to chat completions"
git commit -m "fix: resolve timeout issue in API calls"
git commit -m "docs: update README with new examples"
```

**Generated release notes:**
```
Add streaming support to chat completions; Resolve timeout issue in API calls; Update README with new examples
```

### Example 2: Single Commit
**Your commit:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add deployment management CLI commands"
```

**Generated release notes:**
```
Add deployment management CLI commands
```

### Example 3: Mixed Commits (with chore)
**Your commits:**
```bash
git commit -m "feat: improve error handling"
git commit -m "chore: update dependencies"
git commit -m "fix: resolve streaming bug"
```

**Generated release notes:** (chore commit filtered out)
```
Improve error handling; Resolve streaming bug
```

## Testing the Workflow

To test this fixed workflow:

1. **Make a meaningful commit:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add automatic release notes generation"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Check the GitHub Actions tab** - the workflow should run automatically

3. **Check the Releases page** - you should see a new release with clean notes like:
   ```
   Add automatic release notes generation
   ```

## What Was Fixed

The previous error was caused by:
- Complex bash script with improper line breaks
- Nested loops and complex string processing
- Malformed heredoc syntax

The new version:
- ✅ Simple, linear script
- ✅ Basic string processing
- ✅ Clean output format
- ✅ Proper GitHub Actions syntax

The workflow should now work without the bash syntax errors!
